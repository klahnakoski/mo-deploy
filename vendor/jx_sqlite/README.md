This directory is a stack of classes which used to be one massive class
We hope these clears up the separation enough to perform better refactorings

* **QueryTable** - implement the Container interface
* **AggsTable** - aggregates
* **SetOpTable** - simple set operations
* **InsertTable** - methods for inserting documents
* **BaseTable** - Constructor

* **Snowflake** - Class to manage the Sqlite database; keeping in-memory metadata on the tables that make up the snowflake.
